# Instructions
This code is implemented in C++. To run the code, use an IDE with the C++ language and a compatible compiler. Our group used Visual Studios Code in implementing this code which has the foundations for what is needed to run C++. If you have issues running this in VS Code, run it with the 'Developer Command Prompt for VS <version year>'. To run it from there, navigate to the folder containing the project through the command prompt. Once you are in the directory, open it in VS Code with "code . " (remove the quotation marks). It will open the program in VS Code and allow you to run it.
